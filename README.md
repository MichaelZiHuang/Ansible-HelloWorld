# Ansible-HelloWorld

Repo needs some cleanup, but it's an exploratory project that was built off the Terraform project on EC2.

This project is an exploratory project to understand how Ansible lets us do machine configuration from a single host machine to several controlled machines.

Learned throughout from building a single monolithic playbook to breaking it out into role-based design.
